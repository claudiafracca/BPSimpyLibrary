A Python library that can be used to programmatically generate the executable simulation model for simulation of business processes.
BPSimpy library generates executable simulation model compliant with the Business ProcessSimulation Specification ([BPSim](https://www.bpsim.org/)), a standard from WfMC (Workflow Manage-ment Coalition) that enables a seamless integration with different simulation software products.
